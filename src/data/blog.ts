      <h2>The Shift to Autonomous Workflows</h2>
      <p>Automation is no longer just about moving data from point A to point B. It's about intelligent decision-making. By combining the visual logic of n8n with the reasoning capabilities of OpenAI, we can build agents that not only act, but think.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Defining the Agent's Purpose</h3>
      <p>Before touching any tool, define what the agent is supposed to do. In our case, it's reading incoming support emails, classifying their urgency, and drafting a context-aware response for human review.</p>

      <h3>2. Setting up the n8n Workflow</h3>
      <p>We use the IMAP node to listen for new emails. The payload is then passed to the OpenAI node, using the 'gpt-4' model with a strict system prompt.</p>

      <h3>3. The Prompt Engineering Layer</h3>
      <p>The success of the agent depends entirely on the prompt. You must provide it with examples of 'Urgent' vs 'Low Priority' and define the tone of the drafted response.</p>

      <h2>Why We Get Stuck in Tutorial Hell</h2>
      <p>Tutorials give us a false sense of progress. We follow along, the code works, and we feel like we've learned something. But the moment we face a blank editor, panic sets in.</p>
      
      <h3>The Antidote: Problem-First Learning</h3>
      <p>To escape, you must stop learning technologies in isolation and start learning them as a means to solve a specific problem.</p>

      <h3>Step 1: Find a Micro-Problem</h3>
      <p>Don't try to build the next Facebook. Build a tool that converts CSVs to JSON for a specific niche, or a simple habit tracker for notion users.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Timebox the MVP</h3>
      <p>Give yourself exactly 2 weeks to build the core functionality. No extra features. No perfect design. Just working logic.</p>
